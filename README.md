# ojciek
Ojciek is scaffolding for a SASS based front end project. The goal is to create a starting point independent of which CMS/F is used, even if that means that none is available.

## Use
Combine this project with the startup script located at the [Ojciek gist] (https://gist.github.com/wheatpenny/5826416)

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add  [Ojciek gist] (https://gist.github.com/wheatpenny/5826416) to your Bash profile. Update the URL to the directory where you cloned the repository in step 1.
3. Command: "ojciek [path]" to create responsive scaffolding.
